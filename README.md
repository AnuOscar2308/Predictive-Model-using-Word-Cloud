# Predictive-Model-using-Word-Cloud

1. Theoretical Background:
In this fast-paced world people prefer to have the required information at 
their fingertips. News being the most popular way of starting a day and 
getting a know-how of everything around the world makes it very important 
for the media to keep up with the speed in order to be the most popular media. 
Categorizing news articles allows the reader to only pursue the articles of 
their choice and avoids any time wasted in searching and browsing.

3.  Motivation:
Most projects done in this domain limit themselves to categorizing news as 
fake and true or generating a synopsis of the news while this project is based 
on a more pressing issue of making news faster to access and also suit the 
palette of the reader.

3. Aim of the Proposed Work:
The project aims to compare the accuracies of the existing models in predicting 
the new paper categories from among the following: World, Sports, Business 
and Sci/Tech and find the most accurate match.

4. Objective of the Proposed Work:
The project compares the accuracy of the following algorithms in predicting 
the news article category from among(World, Sports, Business and Sci/Tech):
➔Logistic Regression 
➔Multinomial Naive Bayes 
➔Decision Tree Classifier 
➔Gaussian Naive Bayes
➔Ensemble Model
The most accurate model is then decided upon.
